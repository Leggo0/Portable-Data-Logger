For: Fairfield Osborn Preserve and Chris Halle
Purpose: Create a simple temperatre and humidity data logger
to be used when studying microclimates on the preserve. 
The logger should take accurate data readings, alone with
an accurate time of when the data was taken for future proccessing

There is 2 .ino files associated with this project.
Use the "debug" program when building and testing. 
This file has the same functionality as the deployed file,
the only differences are it opens a serial connection for debugging
and it takes data every second rather than every 60 seconds

The case was designed to be 3D printed and includes 
both a Box and a Lid.
These are designed to be heald together with 1/4 x 1/16 in magnets.
There is a place for a toggle swith on the top as well.
The components used use M2 screws. Since they are not
often found in store, this: https://www.adafruit.com/product/3299
set from Adafruit should be ordered. It will also be included
in the bill of materials.
